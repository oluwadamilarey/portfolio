# Yo!, I'm David!!ðŸ™ƒ

In a phrase I'm a creative, simply put i break stuff and build them back better. They say I'm an Engineer or a developer or a designer, but in reality i'm just an artist and although anything could be my tool of expression,I've come to realize that code expresses me the best.
